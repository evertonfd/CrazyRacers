NOTES:

1. Ground Mud texture is terrain only as it contains smoothness in alpha and does not look good on a mesh tile

2. Post processing stack v2.0 needs to be included in the project in order to use the post processing profiles indluded in the pack

3. All sets are modular and you create different structures from each one.

4. The "Industrial_Zone_Factory_Set" is designed as a structure only and player can not get inside
